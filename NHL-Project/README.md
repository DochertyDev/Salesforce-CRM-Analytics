# INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Download the two csv files from the [Datasets](https://github.com/DochertyDev/Salesforce-CRM-Analytics/tree/main/NHL-Project/Datasets) folder and import them into CRM Analytics as new datasets (leave the names as is, ex: Skaters 24-25).
   - To download new data, access this site https://moneypuck.com/data.htm and get the latest player stats. Update the existing Player and Goalie datasets with the newly downloaded data.

3. Download the [json file](https://github.com/DochertyDev/Salesforce-CRM-Analytics/blob/main/NHL-Project/Recipes/NHL%20Data%20Recipe.json) from the [Recipes](https://github.com/DochertyDev/Salesforce-CRM-Analytics/tree/main/NHL-Project/Recipes) folder and import it into a new CRM Analytics recipe.

4. Download the [json file](https://github.com/DochertyDev/Salesforce-CRM-Analytics/blob/main/NHL-Project/Dashboards/NHL%20Dashboard.json) from the [Dashboards](https://github.com/DochertyDev/Salesforce-CRM-Analytics/tree/main/NHL-Project/Dashboards) folder and paste the code into the code editor of a new dashboard.

   **NOTE:** You will have to replace all the ID's in the dashboard code with ID's created from the recipes new datasets. Locate those datasets in CRM Analytics and take note of their ID in the browser URL (this will be used to point the dashboard code to the right data).
