# INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Download the [json file](https://github.com/DochertyDev/Salesforce-CRM-Analytics/blob/main/Opportunity%20Teams%20Analytics/Recipes/Opportunity%20Team%20Recipe.json) in the [Recipes](https://github.com/DochertyDev/Salesforce-CRM-Analytics/tree/main/Opportunity%20Teams%20Analytics/Recipes) folder and import it into a new CRM Analytics recipe.

2. Move the newly created datasets out of your Private App and into a new folder (if desired).

3. Download the [json file](https://github.com/DochertyDev/Salesforce-CRM-Analytics/blob/main/Opportunity%20Teams%20Analytics/Dashboards/Opportunity%20Team%20Dashboard.json) in the [Dashboards](https://github.com/DochertyDev/Salesforce-CRM-Analytics/tree/main/Opportunity%20Teams%20Analytics/Dashboards) folder and paste the code into the code editor of a new CRM Analytics dashboard.

      **NOTE:** You will have to replace all the ID's in the dashboard code with ID's created from the recipes new datasets. Locate those datasets in CRM Analytics and take note of their ID in the browser URL (this will be used to point the dashboard code to the right data).
